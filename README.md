# Boniface-Thuo

Hi, my name is Boniface Thuo. 
I recently completed my Data Science program at Moringa School, where I gained hands-on experience in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. 

I have worked on projects involving predictive modeling using Python and R and have experience with tools like TensorFlow and Tableau. I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and contribute to data-driven decision-making. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a dynamic environment. 

Would you be open to discussing potential opportunities, or do you have any contacts in the industry?
